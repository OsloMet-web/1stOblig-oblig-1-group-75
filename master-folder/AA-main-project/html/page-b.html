    <p>Jeg, Jørgen Høgset gikk på Kongshavn videregående skole. Det var veldig fint at jeg bodde nærme skolen i forhold til reise. Utover dette 
        så ble jeg kjent med mange kule, og teite mennesker, mest teite. Skolen var svært preget av fest- og sossekultur.

        My high school years were a pleasant time for me.
        My teachers were engaging, and I had the best of friends.
        It was however a challenging time as well; navigating new emotions.
        Yet in the end, I learned a lot about myself. -Birgitta Krømcke

        jeg, Filimon Nuguse gikk på Senja/Finnfjord videregående skole, og 
        deretter flyttet jeg til Bjerke videregående skole for andre og tredje året mitt. 
        En god del av vennene mine kommer fra denne videregående skolen. 
        På Bjerke videregående tilbys mange ulike linjer man kan velge å gå inn i, samt gode felles aktiviteter.

        I am Atilla Reyhanli, I went to Thor Heyerdahl Videregående skole, which is located in Larvik. 
        There I went to study two years of marketing the first years, and the last year i studied påbygg. 
        The best thing about my earlier videregående is mostly the teachers and classmates, a lot of the teachers I
        had, were very good, and a lot of the classmates were fun to hang around with. 
        The worst thing about my videregående was that my classroom was always at the top floor, 
        there were 5 floors in the building and the building is very tall.
